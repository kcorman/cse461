The protocol for the game is as follows
Step 1: Client connects udp socket to server (port specified by GameLobbyServer)
Step 2: Client sends "I'm here" consisting of a single integer (4 bytes): their id as given by the lobby
Step 3: Server replies with ACK consisting of a single byte (1 byte) with the following meanings:
        0: Connection successful, client is on left side
        1: Connection successful, client is on right side
        2: Connection failed, client should drop out
Step 4: Server sends Game State to client consisting of a serialized GameState object
Step 5: Client sends server a Client State consisting of a serialized ClientState object
Step 6: Repeat steps 4-5 infinitely until server blows up?
